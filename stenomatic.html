<em>Greetings mortal, I am the Stenomatic 9000</em>. To utilize my services, copy paste some exercise material (for example, the exercises in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc/lesson-1-fingers-and-keys">Learn Plover</a>) and select what kind of exercise you want to do.  Then press load and go! (If you change any settings, you will need to reload the exercise.)  I am a derivative work of <a href="http://qwertysteno.com/Home/">Qwerty Steno</a>, with whom I share the QWERTY input handling code.  <a href="https://github.com/ezyang/stenomatic">Fork me on GitHub.</a>

<h2>Difficulty:</h2>
You can reduce the difficulty of an exercise by stroking a subset of the keys of the true strokes: this is good for working on muscle memory.  This is only available when working with the QWERTY input mode.  <input type="submit" value="Enable all" onclick="$('#difficultybtns input').prop('checked', true);" /> <input type="submit" value="Clear all" onclick="$('#difficultybtns input').prop('checked', false);" />

You can skip difficult words by filtering them out.

Make sure that you get them straight.  Do not give 
in to slop.  It has no place in your work. 

It is a bad thing to have junk in your drill. 
Keep all of your work clean, clear, neat, and quick. 

If a man knew that this year was the best, 
would he make it the best for him or us?

Ten children are around the back of the school bus. 
There is too much meat in this soup or broth. 

Can you climb very high with that thick brown rope? 
They left the group when they saw they were late. 

Once upon a time, she had a shoe of glass. 
He stuck in his thumb and pulled out a plum. 

Jack and Jill went up the hill to get water. 
Jack fell down and broke his crown.  Oops, too bad. 

They threw the trash out in the dark last night. 
In the dawn they saw the dirt that they made. 

Whether they will or won't is what they should say. 
Ask about the good woman with only one small cat. 

I knew the little car could go like a bullet. 
The truck stood still until it was almost too late. 

Give to me what you think I should have kept. 
Your son is not the one that is new here.

He and me and you and I are hereby the fire.
He, not you or I or they, came from the side.

Keep the dog in the pen in the yard of my friend.
Give six or more to the man with the gold pen.
